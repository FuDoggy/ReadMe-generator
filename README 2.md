# README GENERATOR

## USAGE

This README generator is designed to prompt the user for information for the purpose of populating a README.md file that will have 9 sections: title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, licenses, contributors, test instructions, and questions.  The terminal will prompt the user for 10 questions that will populate the 9 categories, and will create and display the input into the 9 categories.  The app will also format the README.md file in markdown language.
